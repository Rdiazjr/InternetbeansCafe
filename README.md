# netbeansCafe
This is my first project using java and sqlite when I am in senior high school. This application is an attempt to re-create a system for a computer shop/ internet cafe including a membership database.
I used dbrowser for the database and an additional plugin such as the sqlite-jdbc.jar to implement crud in netbeans
